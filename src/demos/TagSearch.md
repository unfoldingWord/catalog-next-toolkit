### Tag Search Example

This component does a very general search and a lot of information is returned.
However, the results are filtered to only show the URLs to the tagged releases.

An example URL built from the attributes might be:
`https://qa.door43.org/api/catalog/v5/search/unfoldingword/en_twl?stage=prod&includeHistory=true`

Feel free to use the URL to see what other data might be available.
```js
<TagSearch owner='unfoldingword' language='en' resource='twl' />
```
